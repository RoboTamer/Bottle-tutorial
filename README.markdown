Bottle todo list tutorial
=========================

This is an slightly enhanced version of the bottle todo tutorial

I am learning python and since I learn best by example I figured I'll share this.

To run it execute following code then go http://localhost:8080 on your browser
<code>
cd Bottle-tutorial

python -m bottle  --debug --reload boot
</code>
